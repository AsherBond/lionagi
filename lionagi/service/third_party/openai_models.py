    ```

    ```

    We emit events whenever a new object is created, transitions to a new state, or is being
    streamed in parts (deltas). For example, we emit `thread.run.created` when a new run
    is created, `thread.run.completed` when a run completes, and so on. When an Assistant chooses
    to create a message during a run, we emit a `thread.message.created event`, a
    `thread.message.in_progress` event, many `thread.message.delta` events, and finally a
    `thread.message.completed` event.

    We may add additional events over time, so we recommend handling unknown events gracefully
    in your code. See the [Assistants API quickstart](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) to learn how to
    integrate the Assistants API with streaming.
