#     Initializes and returns an AWS session, optionally configured with a specified profile and region.
#     This function creates an AWS session that can be used to interact with AWS services. The session can
#     be optionally configured with a specific profile and region. If the profile name is provided, the session
#     uses the credentials and configuration associated with that profile, typically defined in the AWS
#     credentials and config files. Specifying a region name configures the session to operate within a
#     specific AWS region, essential for accessing region-scoped services and resources.

#     Args:
#         profile_name (str | None): The name of the AWS profile to use for configuring the session.
#                                    If None, the default profile or environment credentials are used.
#                                    Profiles are managed through AWS configuration files.
#         region_name (str | None): The name of the AWS region where the session will operate.
#                                   Defaults to "us-west-2" if not specified. The region determines
#                                   which geographical location the session's AWS services will interact with.
#     Returns:
#         session.Session: An instance of an AWS session configured with the given profile and region settings.
#                          This session object can be utilized to access and manage AWS services.
#     Example:
#         # Initialize a session with the default profile in the 'us-west-2' region
#         default_session = setup_session_by_profile(None)
#         # Initialize a session with a custom profile in the 'eu-central-1' region
#         custom_session = setup_session_by_profile('myCustomProfile', 'eu-central-1')

#     Note:
#         The AWS SDK (boto3) must be configured correctly with the necessary credentials and configurations
#         for the specified profile. This involves setting up the ~/.aws/credentials and ~/.aws/config files
#         with the appropriate access keys, secret keys, and other configuration details.

#     Creates an AWS session using credentials and region information from a configuration singleton or environment variables.
#     This function attempts to create an AWS session by first trying to decode and use AWS credentials (access key and
#     secret access key) provided by the `config` object, a ConfigSingleton instance. If the `config` does not have the
#     required credentials, it falls back to environment variables. The AWS region is also set based on the `config` object
#     or an environment variable, defaulting to 'us-west-2' if not specified anywhere. It ensures secure handling of credentials
#     by expecting them to be base64 encoded, both in the configuration and the environment variables. On successful creation
#     of the session, an informational log is generated. In case of failure, due to missing or invalid credentials, an error
#     log is produced.

#     Args:
#         config (_config_.ConfigSingleton | None): The configuration object containing AWS credentials and region info.

#         logger (Log | None): An optional logger for logging the status of AWS session creation. Defaults to None, in
#                              which case logging may not be performed unless a default logger is implemented in the
#                              `_common_` module.
#     Returns:
#         session.Session: An AWS session object configured with the specified credentials and region. If the function
#                          fails to create a session due to missing or invalid credentials, it may raise an exception
#                          or return None, depending on the implementation of the `_common_.error_logger`.

#     Note:
#         - The AWS credentials (access key and secret access key) must be base64 encoded in the configuration or the
#           environment variables for security reasons.
#         - It's essential to have the appropriate AWS credentials and region information correctly set up either in the
#           `config` object or as environment variables for the successful creation of an AWS session.

#     Example:
#         use environment variables:

#         export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<aws access key id in base64 encoded>
#         export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<aws access key id in base64 encoded>
