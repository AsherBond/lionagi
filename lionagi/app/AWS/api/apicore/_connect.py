#     This function initializes a session for a given object type by leveraging a configuration

#     in the registered objects dictionary. If the object type is found, it yields a new session
#     object pointer for that type, initialized with the singleton configuration. If the object
#     type is not found, it logs an error message listing the supported object types.

#     Args:
#         object_type (str): The type of the object for which to create a session.
#         logger (Log, optional): A logger object for logging error messages. Defaults to None,

#     Binds a session object of a specified type to the decorated function.
