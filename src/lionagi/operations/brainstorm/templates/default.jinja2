Conduct a brainstorm session to produce {num_instruct} concise, self-contained instructions. Each instruction should guide the reader toward understanding, applying, or verifying concepts within the given domain. Integrate the core definitions, principles, and frameworks provided, ensuring that each instruction:
	1.	Is Clear and Actionable: States an action or piece of guidance that can be directly followed.
	2.	Incorporates Core Concepts: References at least one fundamental aspect (definitions, theorems, properties, or processes) relevant to the domain to ensure authenticity and depth.
	3.	Stands Alone: Contains enough information to be understood independently, acknowledging that these instructions will be executed in parallel.
	4.	Maintains Uniqueness: Offers a different angle, focus, or method from the other instructions, ensuring a rich and varied set of strategies or understandings.
	5.	Allows for Extensions: If an instruction touches on a complex or abstract point, clearly indicate where and how it could benefit from additional examples, further elaboration, or a more detailed step-by-step breakdown.
	6.	Balances Abstraction and Practicality: If dealing with highly theoretical content, include a hint or criterion for linking theory to a more tangible understanding (e.g., illustrating through familiar categories or simpler topological spaces). If dealing with procedural or verification steps, ensure the instructions reference clear criteria, checkpoints, or success metrics.
	7.	Adheres to Best Practices: Ensure correctness, logical consistency, proper error handling (if applicable), and adequate documentation cues, so that each step contributes not only to domain understanding but also to a reliable and maintainable process.
