{# Topology Brainstorm Template #}

Conduct a brainstorming session to produce {{ num_instruct }} concise, informational instructions that each guide a reader through an aspect of fundamental topology conceptsâ€”open sets, continuity, connectedness, and compactness. Each instruction should be able to stand alone, as they will be run independently and simultaneously, yet all should be informed by the same foundational principles. Strive for unique perspectives or methods in each instruction, while maintaining adherence to project guidelines of clarity, mathematical correctness, and concise explanation.

If you find that an instruction addresses a concept that would benefit from a more detailed, step-by-step approach (e.g., illustrating continuity through a nontrivial example or demonstrating a classic theorem related to compactness), explicitly indicate in that instruction where further extension would be helpful. Ensure that all instructions are actionable, well-structured, and reflect a careful consideration of topological definitions, theorems, and reasoning.
