       "  1. **Setup and Environment Preparation:**\n",
       "     - **Install FastAPI and Uvicorn:** Ensure FastAPI and Uvicorn are installed. This forms the core framework for developing and running the service.\n",
       "       ```bash\n",
       "       pip install fastapi[all] uvicorn\n",
       "       ```\n",
       "     - **Create a FastAPI Project Structure:** Organize the project directory with clear folders for endpoints, services, and configuration files.\n",
       "  \n",
       "  2. **API Key Management:**\n",
       "     - **Register and Obtain an API Key:** Sign up on the OpenWeatherMap platform to obtain an API key for accessing their weather data.\n",
       "     - **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to store and access the sensitive API key securely.\n",
       "       ```python\n",
       "       import os\n",
       "       \n",
       "       WEATHER_API_KEY = os.getenv('WEATHER_API_KEY')\n",
       "       ```\n",
       "  \n",
       "  3. **Implement the Asynchronous Weather Service:**\n",
       "     - **Asynchronous Request Handling:** Use `httpx` (a Python HTTP client with async capabilities) to fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API asynchronously.\n",
       "       ```bash\n",
       "       pip install httpx\n",
       "       ```\n",
       "     - **Define an Asynchronous Function:**\n",
       "       ```python\n",
       "       import httpx\n",
       "       \n",
       "       async def fetch_weather_data(city: str):\n",
       "           url = f\"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={WEATHER_API_KEY}\"\n",
       "           async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n",
       "               response = await client.get(url)\n",
       "               response.raise_for_status()\n",
       "               return response.json()\n",
       "       ```\n",
       "  \n",
       "  4. **Develop the FastAPI Endpoint:**\n",
       "     - **Create an Endpoint for Weather Data:**\n",
       "       ```python\n",
       "       from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException\n",
       "       \n",
       "       app = FastAPI()\n",
       "       \n",
       "       @app.get(\"/weather/{city}\")\n",
       "       async def get_weather(city: str):\n",
       "           try:\n",
       "               data = await fetch_weather_data(city)\n",
       "               return {\n",
       "                   \"city\": city,\n",
       "                   \"weather\": data['weather'][0]['description'],\n",
       "                   \"temperature\": data['main']['temp']\n",
       "               }\n",
       "           except httpx.RequestError:\n",
       "               raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=\"Error fetching weather data.\")\n",
       "           except httpx.HTTPStatusError as exc:\n",
       "               raise HTTPException(status_code=exc.response.status_code, detail=\"API request failed.\")\n",
       "       ```\n",
       "  \n",
       "  5. **Error Handling Strategically:**\n",
       "     - **Network Issues:** Handle errors related to network problems or API call failures using try-except blocks.\n",
       "     - **Invalid Responses:** Manage scenarios where the API returns an error (such as a city not found) by catching HTTP errors and returning an appropriate HTTP response code using FastAPI's `HTTPException`.\n",
       "  \n",
       "  6. **Testing and Validation:**\n",
       "     - **Run the Service Locally:** Use Uvicorn to run the FastAPI application and test the weather endpoint.\n",
       "       ```bash\n",
       "       uvicorn main:app --reload\n",
       "       ```\n",
       "     - **Module Testing:** Implement unit tests to ensure the endpoint returns expected results for valid and invalid city inputs.\n",
       "  \n",
       "  ### Conclusion\n",
       "  \n",
       "  This setup assesses the candidateâ€™s ability to integrate external services, apply asynchronous programming, and implement robust error handling within a FastAPI framework. The modular design also provides an opportunity to extend the service with additional features or endpoints.\n",

       "  \n",
       "  3. **JSON Response Structure**: The response JSON is structured to include `temperature`, `humidity`, and `weather_description`, which aligns with typical weather query outputs.\n",
       "  \n",
       "  4. **Environment Adaptation**: The API key should be securely managed, possibly using environment variables or a secrets manager in a real-world application.\n",
       "  \n",
       "  5. **Documentation and Endpoint Clarity**: The details of the API query, such as parameter use and response format, are clearly reflected, aiding any potential users or developers in understanding how to use the endpoint effectively. \n",
       "  \n",
       "  This code provides a comprehensive, asynchronous approach to creating a FastAPI service that connects to an external weather data source safely and effectively.\n",

       "      ## Instruction for Developing a FastAPI Weather Service\n",
       "      \n",
       "      ### Overview\n",
       "      \n",
       "      This task involves creating a FastAPI service that interacts with an external weather API, such as OpenWeatherMap, to fetch and serve real-time weather data. The candidate will demonstrate proficiency with asynchronous programming and error handling, showcasing an ability to build resilient, modular applications.\n",
       "      \n",
       "      ### Step-by-Step Guide\n",
       "      \n",
       "      1. **Setup and Environment Preparation:**\n",
       "         - **Install FastAPI and Uvicorn:** Ensure FastAPI and Uvicorn are installed. This forms the core framework for developing and running the service.\n",
       "           ```bash\n",
       "           pip install fastapi[all] uvicorn\n",
       "           ```\n",
       "         - **Create a FastAPI Project Structure:** Organize the project directory with clear folders for endpoints, services, and configuration files.\n",
       "      \n",
       "      2. **API Key Management:**\n",
       "         - **Register and Obtain an API Key:** Sign up on the OpenWeatherMap platform to obtain an API key for accessing their weather data.\n",
       "         - **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to store and access the sensitive API key securely.\n",
       "           ```python\n",
       "           import os\n",
       "           \n",
       "           WEATHER_API_KEY = os.getenv('WEATHER_API_KEY')\n",
       "           ```\n",
       "      \n",
       "      3. **Implement the Asynchronous Weather Service:**\n",
       "         - **Asynchronous Request Handling:** Use `httpx` (a Python HTTP client with async capabilities) to fetch data from the OpenWeatherMap API asynchronously.\n",
       "           ```bash\n",
       "           pip install httpx\n",
       "           ```\n",
       "         - **Define an Asynchronous Function:**\n",
       "           ```python\n",
       "           import httpx\n",
       "           \n",
       "           async def fetch_weather_data(city: str):\n",
       "               url = f\"http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city}&appid={WEATHER_API_KEY}\"\n",
       "               async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:\n",
       "                   response = await client.get(url)\n",
       "                   response.raise_for_status()\n",
       "                   return response.json()\n",
       "           ```\n",
       "      \n",
       "      4. **Develop the FastAPI Endpoint:**\n",
       "         - **Create an Endpoint for Weather Data:**\n",
       "           ```python\n",
       "           from fastapi import FastAPI, HTTPException\n",
       "           \n",
       "           app = FastAPI()\n",
       "           \n",
       "           @app.get(\"/weather/{city}\")\n",
       "           async def get_weather(city: str):\n",
       "               try:\n",
       "                   data = await fetch_weather_data(city)\n",
       "                   return {\n",
       "                       \"city\": city,\n",
       "                       \"weather\": data['weather'][0]['description'],\n",
       "                       \"temperature\": data['main']['temp']\n",
       "                   }\n",
       "               except httpx.RequestError:\n",
       "                   raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=\"Error fetching weather data.\")\n",
       "               except httpx.HTTPStatusError as exc:\n",
       "                   raise HTTPException(status_code=exc.response.status_code, detail=\"API request failed.\")\n",
       "           ```\n",
       "      \n",
       "      5. **Error Handling Strategically:**\n",
       "         - **Network Issues:** Handle errors related to network problems or API call failures using try-except blocks.\n",
       "         - **Invalid Responses:** Manage scenarios where the API returns an error (such as a city not found) by catching HTTP errors and returning an appropriate HTTP response code using FastAPI's `HTTPException`.\n",
       "      \n",
       "      6. **Testing and Validation:**\n",
       "         - **Run the Service Locally:** Use Uvicorn to run the FastAPI application and test the weather endpoint.\n",
       "           ```bash\n",
       "           uvicorn main:app --reload\n",
       "           ```\n",
       "         - **Module Testing:** Implement unit tests to ensure the endpoint returns expected results for valid and invalid city inputs.\n",
       "      \n",
       "      ### Conclusion\n",
       "      \n",
       "      This setup assesses the candidateâ€™s ability to integrate external services, apply asynchronous programming, and implement robust error handling within a FastAPI framework.

       "      \n",
       "      3. **JSON Response Structure**: The response JSON is structured to include `temperature`, `humidity`, and `weather_description`, which aligns with typical weather query outputs.\n",
       "      \n",
       "      4. **Environment Adaptation**: The API key should be securely managed, possibly using environment variables or a secrets manager in a real-world application.\n",
       "      \n",
       "      5. **Documentation and Endpoint Clarity**: The details of the API query, such as parameter use and response format, are clearly reflected, aiding any potential users or developers in understanding how to use the endpoint effectively. \n",

       "      \n",
       "      2. **Error Resilience and Logging**:\n",
       "         - Used Python's standard `logging` for error tracking and log messages, providing insights into the application's flow and any arising issues.\n",
       "         - Implemented retry logic with `tenacity` to handle transient failures in network requests.\n",
       "      \n",
       "      3. **Asynchronous Requests**:\n",
       "         - Made use of `httpx.AsyncClient` for non-blocking HTTP requests, improving the efficiency of network I/O operations.\n",
       "         \n",
       "      4. **Configuration Management**:\n",
       "         - Stored API-related constants in a configuration file allowing easy changes and environment-specific settings. \n",
       "      \n",
