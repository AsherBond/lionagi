DeepSeek-R1-Zero, a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step, demonstrates remarkable reasoning capabilities. Through RL, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerges with numerous powerful and intriguing reasoning behaviors. However, it encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. DeepSeekR1 achieves performance comparable to OpenAI-o1-1217 on reasoning tasks. To support the research community, we open-source DeepSeek-R1-Zero, DeepSeek-R1, and six dense models (1.5B, 7B, 8B, 14B, 32B, 70B) distilled from DeepSeek-R1 based on Qwen and Llama.\\n\\nFigure 1 | Benchmark performance of DeepSeek-R1.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Contents\\n\\n| 1 Introduction                            | 1 Introduction                                                                               | 1 Introduction                                                                               |   3 |\\n|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----|\\n| 1.1                                       | Contributions                                                                                | . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .                |   4 |\\n| 1.2                                       | Summary of Evaluation Results . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      | Summary of Evaluation Results . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .      |   4 |\\n| 2                                         | Approach                                                                                     | Approach                                                                                     |   5 |\\n| 2.1                                       | Overview . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . | Overview . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . |   5 |\\n| 2.2                                       | DeepSeek-R1-Zero: Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model                                   | . . . . . . . . . .                                                                          |   5 |\\n|                                           | 2.2.1                                                                                        | Reinforcement Learning Algorithm . . . . . . \"\n",

Introduction\\n\\nIn recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been undergoing rapid iteration and evolution (Anthropic, 2024; Google, 2024; OpenAI, 2024a), progressively diminishing the gap towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).\\n\\nRecently, post-training has emerged as an important component of the full training pipeline. It has been shown to enhance accuracy on reasoning tasks, align with social values, and adapt to user preferences, all while requiring relatively minimal computational resources against pre-training. In the context of reasoning capabilities, OpenAI's o1 (OpenAI, 2024b) series models were the first to introduce inference-time scaling by increasing the length of the Chain-ofThought reasoning process. This approach has achieved significant improvements in various reasoning tasks, such as mathematics, coding, and scientific reasoning. However, the challenge of effective test-time scaling remains an open question for the research community. Several prior works have explored various approaches, including process-based reward models (Lightman et al., 2023; Uesato et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), reinforcement learning (Kumar et al., 2024), and search algorithms such as Monte Carlo Tree Search and Beam Search (Feng et al., 2024; Trinh et al., 2024; Xin et al., 2024). However, none of these methods has achieved general reasoning performance comparable to OpenAI's o1 series models.\\n\\nIn this paper, we take the first step toward improving language model reasoning capabilities using pure reinforcement learning (RL). Our goal is to explore the potential of LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities without any supervised data, focusing on their self-evolution through a pure RL process. Specifically, we use DeepSeek-V3-Base as the base model and employ GRPO (Shao et al., 2024) as th\"\n",

During training, DeepSeek-R1-Zero naturally emerged with numerous powerful and interesting reasoning behaviors. After thousands of RL steps, DeepSeek-R1-Zero exhibits super performance on reasoning benchmarks. For instance, the pass@1 score on AIME 2024 increases from 15.6% to 71.0%, and with majority voting, the score further improves to 86.7%, matching the performance of OpenAI-o1-0912.\\n\\nHowever, DeepSeek-R1-Zero encounters challenges such as poor readability, and language mixing. To address these issues and further enhance reasoning performance, we introduce DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates a small amount of cold-start data and a multi-stage training pipeline. Specifically, we begin by collecting thousands of cold-start data to fine-tune the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. Following this, we perform reasoning-oriented RL like DeepSeek-R1Zero. Upon nearing convergence in the RL process, we create new SFT data through rejection sampling on the RL checkpoint, combined with supervised data from DeepSeek-V3 in domains such as writing, factual QA, and self-cognition, and then retrain the DeepSeek-V3-Base model. After fine-tuning with the new data, the checkpoint undergoes an additional RL process, taking into account prompts from all scenarios. After these steps, we obtained a checkpoint referred to as DeepSeek-R1, which achieves performance on par with OpenAI-o1-1217.\\n\\nWe further explore distillation from DeepSeek-R1 to smaller dense models. Using Qwen2.532B (Qwen, 2024b) as the base model, direct distillation from DeepSeek-R1 outperforms applying RL on it. This demonstrates that the reasoning patterns discovered by larger base models are crucial for improving reasoning capabilities. We open-source the distilled Qwen and Llama (Dubey et al., 2024) series. Notably, our distilled 14B model outperforms state-of-the-art open-source QwQ-32B-Preview (Qwen, 2024a) by a large margin, and the distilled 32B and 70B models set a new record on the reasoning benchmarks among dense models.\\n\\n## 1.1. Contributions\\n\\n## Post-Training: Large-Scale Reinforcement Learning on the Base Model\\n\\n- · We directly apply reinforcement learning (RL) to the base model without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step. This approach allows the model to explore chain-of-thought (CoT) for solving complex problems, resulting in the development of DeepSeek-R1-Zero. DeepSeek-R1-Zero demonstrates capabilities such as self-verification, reflection, and generating long CoTs, marking a significant milestone for the research community. Notably, it is the first open research to validate that reasoning capabilities of LLMs can be incentivized purely through RL, without the need for SFT. This breakthrough paves the way for future advancements in this area.\\n- · We introduce our pipeline to develop DeepSeek-R1. The pipeline incorporates two RL stages aimed at discovering improved reasoning patterns and aligning with human prefe\"\n",

       "# Comparative Analysis of Reinforcement Learning in Large Language Models for Reasoning\n",
       "\n",
       "The paper 'DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning' introduces two reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1, developed using reinforcement learning without supervised fine-tuning. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, trained with pure reinforcement learning, exhibits significant improvements in reasoning tasks, achieving high scores on benchmarks. However, it faces challenges in readability and language mixing. To address these issues, DeepSeek-R1 employs a multi-stage training pipeline involving cold-start data and reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning. The paper also explores the distillation of DeepSeek-R1 into smaller models, demonstrating superior performance over larger models by preserving reasoning patterns.\n",
       "\n",
       "In comparison with recent publications, such as 'Training Large Language Models for Reasoning through Reverse Curriculum Reinforcement Learning' and 'Teaching Large Language Models to Reason with Reinforcement Learning', the DeepSeek paper shares a common focus on enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs through reinforcement learning. However, while the DeepSeek paper emphasizes a pure RL approach without supervised fine-tuning, other studies explore hybrid methods combining RL with supervised learning or curriculum-based strategies. For instance, the 'Reverse Curriculum Reinforcement Learning' paper introduces a curriculum-based approach, which gradually increases task complexity, allowing models to learn reasoning in stages.\n",
       "\n",
       "Additionally, the paper 'Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Large Language Model Priors' discusses using LLM priors to guide RL processes, contrasting with DeepSeek's pure RL methodology. The paper 'Integrating Large Language Models and Reinforcement Learning for Non-Linear Reasoning' explores combining LLMs with RL for complex reasoning tasks, similar to DeepSeek's goal but with a different focus on non-linear reasoning.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, DeepSeek-R1's methodology of using a pure RL approach without initial supervised fine-tuning is a distinctive feature compared to recent research, which often combines RL with other learning strategies. The results from DeepSeek-R1 highlight the potential of pure RL in developing reasoning capabilities, setting it apart in terms of methodology and performance outcomes.\n",

       "    \"content\": \"The paper 'DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning' introduces two reasoning models, DeepSeek-R1-Zero and DeepSeek-R1, developed using reinforcement learning without supervised fine-tuning. DeepSeek-R1-Zero, trained with pure reinforcement learning, exhibits significant improvements in reasoning tasks, achieving high scores on benchmarks. However, it faces challenges in readability and language mixing. To address these issues, DeepSeek-R1 employs a multi-stage training pipeline involving cold-start data and reasoning-oriented reinforcement learning. The paper also explores the distillation of DeepSeek-R1 into smaller models, demonstrating superior performance over larger models by preserving reasoning patterns.\\n\\nIn comparison with recent publications, such as 'Training Large Language Models for Reasoning through Reverse Curriculum Reinforcement Learning' and 'Teaching Large Language Models to Reason with Reinforcement Learning', the DeepSeek paper shares a common focus on enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs through reinforcement learning. However, while the DeepSeek paper emphasizes a pure RL approach without supervised fine-tuning, other studies explore hybrid methods combining RL with supervised learning or curriculum-based strategies. For instance, the 'Reverse Curriculum Reinforcement Learning' paper introduces a curriculum-based approach, which gradually increases task complexity, allowing models to learn reasoning in stages.\\n\\nAdditionally, the paper 'Efficient Reinforcement Learning with Large Language Model Priors' discusses using LLM priors to guide RL processes, contrasting with DeepSeek's pure RL methodology. The paper 'Integrating Large Language Models and Reinforcement Learning for Non-Linear Reasoning' explores combining LLMs with RL for complex reasoning tasks, similar to DeepSeek's goal but with a different focus on non-linear reasoning.\\n\\nOverall, DeepSeek-R1's methodology of using a pure RL approach without initial supervised fine-tuning is a distinctive feature compared to recent research, which often combines RL with other learning strategies. The results from DeepSeek-R1 highlight the potential of pure RL in developing reasoning capabilities, setting it apart in terms of methodology and performance outcomes.\",\n",
