# LionAGI v1.0.0 – Architecture & Roadmap

## Architecture Overview: High-Level Design Shifts

LionAGI v1.0.0 is reimagined as a **high-level agent orchestration and reasoning engine**, focused on coordinating multiple agents, managing memory, and abstracting tool usage. The core idea is to **slim down LionAGI’s responsibilities** by delegating low-level tasks to specialized layers: `pydapter` for data/storage adapters and `khive.d` for service orchestration. This makes LionAGI framework-agnostic, modular, and enterprise-ready. The diagram below illustrates the new architecture:

```

In this design, **LionAGI serves as the brains** coordinating conversation and reasoning, while **pydapter and khive.d serve as the muscles** handling data I/O and external actions. LionAGI remains backend-agnostic – it doesn’t hard-code any database or LLM API, but relies on pluggable adapters and services. Crucially, this lays groundwork for future integration with a Rust-based microkernel and capability-based security by clearly separating concerns and defining narrow interfaces between components.

## Core Modules & Responsibilities

Under the new modular architecture, LionAGI is structured into clear components with focused responsibilities. The table below defines the core modules and how they interact:

| **Module**                      | **Role in v1.0 Architecture**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Session Manager**             | Top-level controller managing one or more conversation **branches** (agents). It holds all active agents and orchestrates inter-agent communication. The Session ensures parallel or sequential branches can run in one context. It also maintains a `default_branch` (primary agent context) and manages a global “mail” system for message passing between agents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Branch (Agent)**              | Represents an individual agent (a conversation thread with its own state). A Branch contains the agent’s **messages, tools, and models** and handles the agent’s local logic (message accumulation, invoking tools, calling LLMs). In v1.0, a Branch becomes a lightweight container: it delegates heavy tasks to the Context Manager (for memory) and to the Service layer (for LLM calls via Khive). Each Branch can be given a role or persona via a system prompt, enabling **role delegation** for multi-agent setups.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Orchestrator**                | A higher-level coordination module (likely part of Session) that can manage complex multi-agent workflows or long-running tasks. The Orchestrator can spawn or schedule branches, assign tasks to different agents, and sequence their interactions. For example, an Orchestrator could implement a planning loop that uses one agent to generate a plan and others to execute sub-tasks. It works with the Session to coordinate agent creation and message routing, acting as a “conductor” for the agents.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Mail/Exchange System**        | The intra-agent messaging mechanism for LionAGI. It allows agents (Branches) to send `Mail` packages to each other via the Session. The Session’s `MailManager` or `Exchange` collects outgoing messages from one branch and delivers them to target branches. This enables agents to communicate asynchronously or in turn-taking fashion. (E.g. Agent A’s output can be forwarded as input to Agent B.) The mail system forms the backbone of **multi-agent coordination** out-of-the-box.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Context Manager**             | Handles **memory management and context assembly** for agents. On each agent query, the Context Manager determines what supplemental information to provide (e.g. long-term memory, relevant documents). It interfaces with the MemoryStore to fetch prior knowledge, embeddings, or saved context related to the conversation or task. It may also handle context **window management** (summarizing or truncating conversation history) so that each LLM call gets the most relevant context. By abstracting this logic into a module, LionAGI agents remain **aware of context** but not tied to *how* it’s retrieved.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **MemoryStore API**             | An **abstract interface for persistent memory and knowledge**. Instead of hard-coding a particular vector database or storage, LionAGI defines a MemoryStore protocol (e.g. with methods like `save(item)`, `query(similarity)` etc.). Under the hood, this is implemented using Pydapter adapters to connect to actual data stores. For example, a MemoryStore could use a Qdrant adapter (via Pydapter) to store and retrieve embeddings, or a Postgres adapter for structured memory. This decoupling means agents can use memory and data seamlessly without knowing the storage details. Pydapter’s broad support for formats and databases (JSON, CSV, SQL, Mongo, Neo4j, Qdrant, etc.) ensures **LionAGI’s memory interface is backend-agnostic**.                                                       |
| **Action/Tool Interface**       | A unified **tool usage abstraction** for agents. In current LionAGI, each Branch has an `ActionManager` that registers and invokes tools (functions). In v1.0, this gets formalized as a Tool Interface module that an agent can call to perform an action (e.g. “search the web” or “call API X”). The Tool interface looks up the appropriate implementation – many simple tools might still be internal Python functions, but for complex or privileged actions, the interface will route the request to **Khive.d**. This design means agents just declare *what* they want to do, and the execution is handled by either a safe internal routine or by the external service layer. Capability-based security can be enforced here by restricting which tools/capabilities each agent is allowed to invoke. |
| **Service Proxy (LLM Gateway)** | (Part of the Tool Interface or separate module) – This handles **language model calls and external API requests** on behalf of agents. Instead of Branches calling external APIs directly, the Service Proxy funnels requests to `khive.d` services. For example, when an agent needs to get an LLM completion, the proxy formats the request and sends it to a Khive-managed endpoint (which could call OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). Similarly, web search or other API tools would be invoked via the service layer. By delegating through a proxy, LionAGI core doesn’t need provider-specific code – it just hands off to Khive.d which takes care of routing to the correct API or model.                                                                                                                     |

All these modules interact to provide a powerful yet flexible agent framework. For instance, when a **Branch (agent)** needs to generate a response, it might call the Context Manager to enrich the prompt with related facts (via MemoryStore/Pydapter), then use the Service Proxy to get an LLM completion from an external model, and possibly call the Tool Interface for any actions (which may loop back via Khive services). The Session/Orchestrator oversees this process especially when multiple agents are involved.

## Multi-Agent Coordination & Reasoning

LionAGI v1.0 is built to **support multi-agent reasoning out-of-the-box**. The Session manager can host multiple Branches (agents) concurrently, each with its own role or expertise. Key features enabling coordination include:

* **Intra-Agent Messaging:** Agents can communicate through the Session’s mail system. One agent’s output can be packaged as a message and delivered to another agent. LionAGI provides methods like `Session.collect(from_branches)` and `Session.send(to_branches)` to facilitate this routing. For example, Agent A (a “Researcher”) could send its findings to Agent B (a “Planner”) for further action. All this happens within the same session context, so it’s straightforward to set up multi-agent dialogues.

* **Role Delegation:** Each Branch can be initialized with a different system prompt or configuration to assume a distinct role (e.g. a “Coder” agent vs. a “Critic” agent). The Session can spawn new branches via `new_branch()` and assign roles or initial tools to them. Because the branches share the Session, they can cooperate on tasks while still maintaining separate internal state. LionAGI will include patterns or templates to easily create common agent roles and assign them specific capabilities or tools.

* **Coordinated Orchestration:** The Orchestrator module (as part of Session) can coordinate complex workflows among agents. This could include sequential workflows (Agent 1 -> Agent 2 -> Agent 3) or even parallel operations. For instance, the Orchestrator might divide a problem into sub-tasks, have multiple agents work on parts, then aggregate the results. It can use the mail system to broadcast a message to multiple agents and wait for their responses, or trigger one agent after another finishes. Long-running or iterative tasks can be managed by the Orchestrator via loops or scheduled callbacks (possibly integrating with async features or an event loop).

* **Long-Running Tasks:** By keeping branches alive and capable of storing state, LionAGI can handle tasks that span multiple steps and time periods. An agent could, for example, perform a series of web searches, accumulate results in its memory, and refine its answer over an extended dialogue. The design supports this by not tying an agent’s life-cycle to a single API call – an agent/Branch persists within the Session and can be re-invoked or receive new messages indefinitely. The Orchestrator could also interface with external scheduling (or the future microkernel) to wake agents for periodic tasks or background processing, making LionAGI suitable for persistent agent services.

LionAGI’s built-in multi-agent support provides **coordination primitives and structure**, so users can easily spin up complex agent systems (e.g. a team of specialized AI agents collaborating on a project). This is achieved while maintaining thread-safe, asynchronous operation (the internal design uses Python async features, enabling concurrent agent operations where applicable).

## Memory Management & Data Integration via Pydapter

A cornerstone of LionAGI v1.0 is robust memory management that is not bound to any single database or vector store. This is achieved by leveraging **Pydapter** as a data adaptation layer:

* **Decoupled Memory Store:** LionAGI will define a `MemoryStore` interface for reading/writing conversational memory, embeddings, or agent knowledge. The actual storage backend (be it an in-memory vector index, a persistent database, or a knowledge graph) is **plugged in via Pydapter adapters**. LionAGI’s own earlier adapter system (mapping formats like JSON, CSV, etc., to adapter classes) is being superseded by Pydapter’s more powerful toolkit. Pydapter already supports two-way conversion for many formats and databases, meaning LionAGI can use it to send data to, or fetch data from, virtually any source.

* **Vector Database Integration:** For example, to support semantic memory (long-term memory of embeddings), one can use Pydapter’s Qdrant or Weaviate adapter. An agent’s important conversation snippets or documents can be converted to vector embeddings and stored. Later, when context is needed, the ContextManager will query the `MemoryStore`, which under the hood uses Pydapter to perform a similarity search in Qdrant and return relevant data. LionAGI’s agents thus gain memory recall abilities without LionAGI itself containing vector DB logic – it simply interacts through the adapter interface.

* **Relational/Document Data:** Similarly, if an enterprise uses a SQL database or a document store for knowledge, Pydapter can interface with it (it lists support for PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Neo4j, etc.). The agent could ask for some record or structured data; the MemoryStore can retrieve it via an appropriate adapter. This could be used for tools like “CRM lookup” or “fetch user profile” – LionAGI would call `MemoryStore.get("user:123")` and Pydapter’s adapter might translate that to a SQL query or API call. All of this happens through a consistent interface, keeping LionAGI’s codebase agnostic to data sources.

* **Context Assembly:** The ContextManager uses the MemoryStore to gather any external info needed to supplement the agent’s short-term conversation. For instance, before calling the LLM for a response, the ContextManager might fetch the top 5 relevant knowledge entries (embedding matches) and provide them as additional system messages or as part of the prompt. This greatly enhances the agent’s capabilities (allowing retrieval-augmented generation, etc.) while LionAGI itself remains a **controller** – the heavy lifting of retrieval is done by the adapter layer.

* **No Single-Point Dependency:** By delegating all data I/O to Pydapter, LionAGI ensures it doesn’t become tightly coupled to a single vector store or file format. It can operate in **enterprise environments** where data governance requires using approved databases, because one can write or configure a Pydapter adapter for that source and LionAGI will use it. It also means easier maintenance: updates to database drivers or formats are handled in Pydapter, not deep in LionAGI’s code.

In summary, memory in LionAGI v1.0 is a **first-class feature** with a pluggable backend. Agents can “remember” and “reference” information beyond the immediate chat history, and this design is scalable and secure (data access can be controlled at the adapter level, and eventually via capability security in the microkernel).

## Tool Usage & Service Delegation (via Khive.d)

LionAGI v1.0 emphasizes *tool use abstraction* – agents should be able to invoke tools or services by intent, without LionAGI containing the low-level implementation of each tool. The integration with `khive.d` (the service orchestration layer) is pivotal here:

* **Unified Tool Interface:** Agents interact with tools through a common interface (the ActionManager/Tool Interface). To the agent, it might look like calling a Python function or method (e.g., `branch.invoke_tool("web_search", query="xyz")`). Under the hood, the Tool interface checks how this tool is provided. If it’s a simple function (like a string transformation), it might execute locally. But if it’s a complex action (web search, calling an external API, running code), it will hand off the request to the **Khive.d service layer**.

* **Delegating to Khive.d:** Khive.d is envisioned as a separate orchestration service (possibly a daemon or microservice) that knows how to perform certain actions – for example, it might have a service for performing web searches, or for routing requests to different LLMs based on criteria. When LionAGI delegates a tool call to Khive, it likely sends a request (perhaps via an API call, RPC, or message queue) describing what’s needed (e.g., “perform web search for X” or “call GPT-4 with these parameters”). Khive.d then executes the action outside LionAGI’s process and returns the result (search results, LLM response, etc.) back to the agent.

* **Low-Level Logic Removed from LionAGI:** With this shift, all **API integrations and model routing logic leave the LionAGI codebase**. For instance, earlier LionAGI’s `service` module had classes for chat endpoints, token counting, etc.. In the new design, those would either be moved to `khive.d` or become thin wrappers that call out to `khive.d`. LionAGI itself no longer needs to know the details of OpenAI vs. Anthropic APIs, or how to handle OAuth for some web service – it simply asks Khive.d to do it. This makes LionAGI lighter and focused purely on reasoning/orchestration, and it means updates to APIs or new tool integrations can be made in Khive.d without modifying LionAGI’s core.

* **Examples of Tool Delegation:** If an agent needs to use a calculator or run some code, rather than implementing a Python sandbox inside LionAGI, we could have Khive.d handle a “code execution” capability (possibly within a secure container or using the Rust microkernel for safety). If an agent needs to query a company knowledge base, the request goes to a Khive service which interacts with that knowledge base (or uses Pydapter behind the scenes). **LionAGI thus acts as an intelligent coordinator, delegating specialized tasks** to where they can best be handled.

* **Security and Capability Control:** With tools and external calls funneled through a single interface, it becomes easier to enforce security. The system can check an agent’s **capabilities** before honoring a tool request. For example, if an agent is not allowed internet access, the Tool interface can refuse or filter out any “web\_search” calls from that agent. In future integration with a capability-secure microkernel, each Branch/agent might be assigned a capability token that Khive.d verifies before executing a requested action. This model aligns with capability-based security – each service call requires the right capability.

Overall, the collaboration between LionAGI and Khive.d ensures that **LionAGI stays modular and extensible**. New tools or services can be added by extending Khive.d’s offerings, without needing to change LionAGI’s code. Meanwhile, agents can make use of an expanding toolbox just by invoking the high-level interface.

## Future Rust Integration & Security Hooks

Although not implemented in v1.0.0, the architecture is designed with future integration into a **Rust-based microkernel** and capability security model in mind:

* **FFI or API Boundaries:** The clear separation of concerns (LionAGI vs. Khive.d vs. Pydapter) means we could replace or augment parts of the system with Rust components. For instance, Khive.d itself might be a Rust service, or performance-critical sections (like heavy data processing or certain adapters) could be rewritten in Rust and exposed via FFI. The Session and Branch logic could remain in Python, but they would call out to Rust for specific tasks. By defining narrow interfaces (such as a function call for “invoke\_tool” or “store\_vector”), we ensure that switching the implementation to Rust (or WebAssembly) is feasible without altering the LionAGI high-level logic.

* **WebAssembly Sandbox:** In the future, tools or even agent logic might run in a WASM sandbox managed by a microkernel. LionAGI could package an agent’s code or a third-party tool into a WASM module and ask the microkernel to execute it securely. The design’s emphasis on externalizing actions (to Khive.d) aligns with this – Khive.d or the microkernel could execute the action in a sandbox and return the result, keeping the core system safe from untrusted code.

* **Capability-Based Security:** Each module in LionAGI can be seen as requiring certain permissions. For example, the MemoryStore might require “DB access” capability, a tool might require “network access” capability. In v1.0, we will architect the system such that these permissions could be centrally managed. For now, that might simply be configuration or checks in code, but in a future Rust microkernel environment, these would correspond to actual OS-level capabilities. The Branch or Session could be associated with a security context that the microkernel uses to allow or deny requests. Designing LionAGI as a pure orchestrator that always goes through controlled interfaces (MemoryStore, Tool interface) makes it possible to enforce such policies in one place.

* **Isolation of Agents:** We anticipate possibly running different agents in isolated threads or processes (or even on different machines), especially for scaling and security. The architecture already allows an agent’s heavy work to be done outside the main process (via Khive.d services). This could be extended so that each Branch’s LLM reasoning might occur in a separate worker (managed by Rust for efficiency and safety). The communication would still flow through the Session’s messaging system, but the actual computation is isolated. V1.0 sets the stage for this by not assuming agents share memory or a single interpreter – all interactions happen through defined messages and calls.

In short, while v1.0.0 will be implemented in Python (with Pydapter and Khive integration), the structure prepares LionAGI to step into a **polyglot, secure, and high-performance future**. After 1.0, we can gradually replace pieces with Rust or move them into the microkernel, confident that the architecture will support those changes with minimal friction.

## Roadmap to v1.0.0

To achieve this vision, we outline a clear roadmap with milestones that progressively implement the new architecture. Each milestone is scoped to ensure stability and incremental progress toward LionAGI 1.0.0:

**Milestone 1: Migrate and Modularize Tool & Parsing Logic**
*Scope:* Extract low-level logic (parsing, API calling, etc.) from LionAGI’s core into modular layers. For example, if LionAGI Branches currently format API payloads or parse JSON responses, move that into either `khive.d` or a thin adapter. Migrate any built-in tools (file readers, web requests) to use an external service or adapter. This involves auditing the `lionagi.service` module and `lionagi.tools` for functionalities that can be delegated. The outcome is that LionAGI’s core no longer contains custom code for things like web search or model HTTP calls – instead, it will call a service interface.

*Tasks & Deliverables:*

* Refactor `ActionManager`/tools to call an abstract Tool interface. Implement stub classes that forward requests to Khive (or a placeholder service) for things like web search or HTTP calls.
* Remove any direct dependencies on specific APIs. For instance, if `lionagi.service` has an OpenAI client, replace it with a generic service client that calls Khive.d.
* Ensure that parsing of LLM outputs or tool outputs is done in a generic way or moved to where the call is made (e.g. the Khive service returns already parsed results whenever possible).
* **Acceptance:** All unit tests should still pass, but now through the new interface. No loss of functionality, just changing where it lives. This sets the stage for the next milestones by cleaning up the core.

**Milestone 2: Define Formal Interfaces for Context, Memory, and Tools**
*Scope:* Establish clear abstract interfaces/protocols for the ContextManager, MemoryStore, and Tool/Service Proxy. This milestone is about design and API specification within LionAGI, to decouple components. LionAGI will have, for example, a `BaseMemoryStore` class or interface that others can implement (with methods like `store(data: BaseModel)`, `query(criteria) -> List[BaseModel]`). Similarly, define a `ContextManager` that utilizes a MemoryStore (so it might have `attach_memory(store: BaseMemoryStore)` and `get_context(query) -> ContextBundle`). Also formalize the Tool interface (e.g., a `ToolProxy` class with methods `invoke_tool(tool_name, **params)` and perhaps a registry of available tools/capabilities).

*Tasks & Deliverables:*

* Create interface classes or Pydantic protocols for MemoryStore and ContextManager in the LionAGI codebase. Document their methods and expected behaviors.
* Update Branch/Session to use these interfaces. For instance, Branch will call `context = session.context_manager.get_context(current_query)` before an LLM call. Ensure the Branch doesn’t assume any particular memory backend.
* Define how tools are represented (maybe as Pydantic models or simple callables) and how the Tool interface finds/executes them. Possibly introduce a `ToolRegistry` that maps tool names to either internal functions or external service calls.
* This milestone is more about design than user-facing changes, but it’s critical for ensuring the next steps can plug in Pydapter and Khive cleanly. Add unit tests for the new interfaces (e.g., a dummy MemoryStore implementation to test integration with Branch).
* **Acceptance:** The codebase compiles/runs with the new abstractions. Core classes like Branch and Session now depend on interfaces (ContextManager, MemoryStore, ToolProxy) rather than concrete implementations. Documentation is updated to reflect these new APIs.

**Milestone 3: Integrate Pydapter for Data & Memory**
*Scope:* Connect the newly defined MemoryStore and adapter interfaces to **Pydapter**. This involves either using Pydapter’s existing adapters or writing new ones to fulfill the MemoryStore interface. For example, if we want a vector memory, use Pydapter’s Qdrant adapter; if we want to store conversation logs in JSON files or a SQL DB, use the JSON/SQL adapters. Also, reconcile LionAGI’s internal adapter concept with Pydapter – possibly deprecating LionAGI’s AdapterRegistry in favor of Pydapter’s mechanisms.

*Tasks & Deliverables:*

* Implement one or two concrete MemoryStore classes using Pydapter. For instance, `VectorMemoryStore` that wraps Pydapter’s vector DB calls, or `SQLMemoryStore` for relational data. Ensure they adhere to BaseMemoryStore interface.
* Replace instances of LionAGI’s `AdapterRegistry.get()` usage with Pydapter calls. If LionAGI uses AdapterRegistry to transform data formats, refactor those to use Pydapter’s adapters (which might mean calling `Adaptable.adapt_to()` or similar as per Pydapter usage).
* Update test cases for adapters (LionAGI issue #601 and #602 already indicate work on AdapterRegistry improvements; here we might augment tests to ensure MissingAdapterError or precomputed registry logic still works when Pydapter is involved). Potentially, we keep AdapterRegistry for internal mapping but have it delegate to Pydapter under the hood.
* Validate that an agent can successfully store and retrieve data through the new MemoryStore. For example, write a test where an agent saves a fact and later can query it via vector similarity – using Pydapter in between.
* **Acceptance:** LionAGI can plug into an actual database or vector store with minimal configuration, demonstrating backend agnosticism. Documentation or examples show how to configure a MemoryStore (e.g. connecting to Qdrant or Postgres) for LionAGI. The adapter system is streamlined, avoiding redundancy between LionAGI and Pydapter.

**Milestone 4: Delegate Service Logic to Khive.d**
*Scope:* Fully **offload model and tool execution** from LionAGI to Khive.d, achieving the intended separation. At this stage, the Khive.d service(s) should be available (or mocked) to handle requests. We will integrate LionAGI’s Tool interface and Service Proxy with actual calls to Khive.d. This might be done via REST calls, a message queue, or direct Python integration if Khive provides an SDK. The goal is that when an agent in LionAGI needs to do anything external (LLM call, search, etc.), it goes through Khive.d.

*Tasks & Deliverables:*

* Implement the ToolProxy/ServiceProxy to communicate with Khive.d. For example, if Khive.d exposes a REST API at `localhost:8000/search` or a Python client function `khive.search()`, code LionAGI to use that. Ensure it’s done asynchronously if needed (to not block the event loop).
* Migrate the model invocation. Possibly deprecate `lionagi.service.manager.iModelManager` and replace it with a simpler `LLMService` class that calls Khive. E.g., Branch when needing a completion will prepare the prompt and call `KhiveClient.generate(prompt)`, receiving the result. All model routing (which model to use, etc.) can be handled by Khive based on parameters LionAGI sends.
* Ensure tool results and errors propagate correctly. If Khive.d returns an error or exception (e.g., tool not available), decide how LionAGI handles it (perhaps throw a specific exception or give a graceful error message to the agent).
* Create integration tests or a staging environment test: Run a minimal Khive.d service (or a stub) and have a LionAGI agent ask a question that requires using a tool (like “What’s the weather in Paris?” which requires an API call). Verify that LionAGI delegates to Khive.d and gets back a result to present.
* **Acceptance:** At this point, LionAGI can complete complex queries using tools and LLMs without having any direct API keys or service code internally – all external interactions go through Khive.d. We should observe that adding a new tool in Khive.d automatically becomes available to LionAGI agents (once registered in the Tool registry), underscoring the flexibility of the design.

**Milestone 5: Testing, Performance & Agentic Use Case Demos**
*Scope:* Finalize the 1.0 release by thoroughly testing the new architecture, improving performance where needed, and creating documentation/examples that showcase multi-agent capabilities and use of memory/tools. This includes writing new test cases for multi-agent scenarios and ensuring that the refactored system meets enterprise-grade criteria (stability, scalability).

*Tasks & Deliverables:*

* **Comprehensive Testing:** Develop unit tests and integration tests for multi-agent workflows: e.g., two agents solving a task together via the mail system, an agent using memory to answer a question, an agent invoking multiple tools in a sequence. Include failure cases (like tool not available, or memory query returns nothing) to ensure robust handling. Ensure all previous tests (from 0.x versions) still pass under the new system or are updated if behavior changed.
* **Performance Benchmarking:** Since we introduced extra layers (calling external services, using adapters), measure the overhead. Benchmark a simple single-agent conversation in v1.0 vs v0.12 to ensure no significant regressions. If there are slow points (maybe waiting on service calls), consider adding caching or concurrency to hide latency (e.g., allow an agent to stream partial LLM responses if Khive supports it, etc.). The acceptance criteria might include something like “Cold start time for initializing LionAGI is under 1s” or “Typical response latency is within X% of direct API calls.” (From prior plans: e.g., aim for importing LionAGI < 300ms after optimizations).
* **Documentation & Examples:** Write documentation pages or notebooks demonstrating the new features. For instance, an example of setting up two agents with different roles in a Session and having them collaborate on a task (leveraging the Session’s multi-branch capabilities). Another example showing how to configure LionAGI with a particular vector store via Pydapter. Possibly an end-to-end tutorial where an agent uses memory and tools to achieve a complex goal (this serves as a showcase of agentic behavior).
* **Final Checks:** Conduct a security review of the new architecture – even if full capability security isn’t in place yet, ensure sensible defaults (e.g., an agent can’t arbitrarily execute a system command unless a tool explicitly allows it, etc.). Also, verify that the system works in a scaled setting (run 5-10 agents concurrently to see if any race conditions or resource issues arise). Address any bugs found during this process.
* **Release:** Bump version to 1.0.0, update `pyproject.toml` metadata, and prepare release notes highlighting the major changes: modular architecture, delegation to Pydapter/Khive, multi-agent orchestration, and readiness for integration with the Rust microkernel going forward.

Each milestone above builds on the previous, ensuring that by the time we reach v1.0.0, LionAGI has fully embraced its new role as a lean but powerful orchestration engine. The result will be a **secure, modular, and scalable LionAGI 1.0**, capable of coordinating multiple intelligent agents with memory and tool-use, all while integrating smoothly into a larger ecosystem (data stores, services, and eventually low-level kernels). This roadmap not only transforms LionAGI’s internals but also provides a clear path for future enhancements as envisioned by the user.
