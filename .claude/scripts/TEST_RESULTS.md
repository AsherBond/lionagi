# Task Master Test Results

## What We Tested

We successfully tested the KB Task Master system with real GitHub issues to
ensure the orchestrator won't complete tasks prematurely.

### Setup

1. Created GitHub labels for KB lifecycle stages:
   - `stage:research.requested`
   - `stage:research.proposed`
   - `stage:research.active`
   - `stage:decision.ready`
   - `stage:decision.review`
   - `priority:high`, `priority:medium`
   - `category:MEM`, `category:AIO`
   - `status:blocked`

2. Created 5 test issues representing different KB lifecycle stages:
   - 2 research requests (intake needed)
   - 1 research proposal (planning needed)
   - 1 active research (in progress)
   - 1 blocked decision (needs intervention)

### Test Results

#### ✅ Task Detection

The task master correctly identified all 5 issues and categorized them:

- Intake: 2 tasks
- Planning: 1 task
- Research: 1 task
- Blocked: 1 task

#### ✅ Priority Ordering

The `--next` command correctly prioritized high-priority tasks first

#### ✅ Gatekeeper Blocking

When tasks were pending, the gatekeeper correctly:

- Returned exit code 1
- Displayed clear error message
- Prevented task completion

#### ✅ Stage Transitions

When we simulated processing (moving issue from `research.requested` to
`research.proposed`), the system correctly:

- Moved the task from "Intake" to "Planning" category
- Maintained accurate task count

#### ✅ Completion Approval

When all issues were closed, the system correctly:

- Showed 0 pending tasks
- Gatekeeper returned exit code 0
- Allowed task completion

## How to Use in Production

1. **For the Orchestrator**:
   ```python
   # Before any task completion
   result = subprocess.run(["python", "simple_gatekeeper.py"])
   if result.returncode != 0:
       # Cannot complete - keep processing
   ```

2. **For Monitoring**:
   ```bash
   # See what needs doing
   python task_master.py --list

   # Get next priority task
   python task_master.py --next
   ```

3. **For CI/CD Integration**:
   ```bash
   # Add to orchestrator scripts
   python simple_gatekeeper.py || exit 1
   ```

## Key Benefits

1. **Simple**: No complex infrastructure, just uses GitHub CLI
2. **Reliable**: Based on GitHub labels as source of truth
3. **Transparent**: Easy to see what's pending and why
4. **Fail-Safe**: Blocks completion when in doubt

The system successfully prevents the primary failure mode: orchestrator
completing tasks while KB events are still pending in the GitHub issue queue.
