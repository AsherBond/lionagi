### Real Email Example (Sent to Jason La Barbera, NVIDIA)

**Context**: Following up after Jason offered to connect Ocean with teams at NVIDIA

**Subject:** Following up - Multi-agent orchestration discussion

Hi Jason,

Thanks for offering to connect me with the right teams. I appreciate you following the work over these months.

I'd love to discuss where orchestration is heading at NVIDIA. We've been working on the long-running agent problem - Friday's demo will show agents running 72+ hours without degradation. Been thinking lately about making this kind of intelligence accessible beyond just enterprise deployments.

Ruv mentioned you've been exploring similar challenges. Would be great to share perspectives and see how Lion might fit into NVIDIA's vision.

I'm flexible on timing this week - what works best for you?

Best,  
Ocean

**Why this works:**
- Opens with gratitude (genuine, not excessive)
- Acknowledges relationship ("following the work over these months")
- Technical achievement stated simply ("72+ hours without degradation")
- Vision hinted subtly ("accessible beyond just enterprise")
- References mutual connection (Ruv)
- Respectful of recipient's time
- Clean, professional close
