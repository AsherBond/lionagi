        ## Welcome to KB Research System

        This template creates a research request that will be automatically processed through our KB lifecycle:
        1. **Intake** - Research proposal generated
        2. **Planning** - Detailed research plan created
        3. **Execution** - Swarm-based research performed
        4. **Decision** - Recommendations synthesized
        5. **Implementation** - Solutions deployed
        6. **Metrics** - Results measured and ROI calculated
