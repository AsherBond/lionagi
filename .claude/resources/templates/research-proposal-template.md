## Field Descriptions

### Identification Fields

- **title**: One-line summary that clearly states what's being researched
- **research_id**: Unique identifier following pattern CATEGORY_###

### Classification Fields

- **category**:
  - AIO: AI/Orchestration
  - MEM: Memory/Persistence
  - TLI: Tools/Integration
  - ARC: Architecture
  - DEV: Developer Experience
  - UXP: User Experience
- **priority**: Based on business impact and urgency
- **complexity**: Technical difficulty and scope
- **confidence_level**: How confident we are in our estimates

### Success Criteria

Must be:

- Specific and unambiguous
- Measurable with clear metrics
- Achievable within constraints
- Relevant to the business need
- Time-bound with deadlines

## Examples

### Example 1: Vector Database Research

```yaml
research_proposal:
  title: "Evaluate Vector Database Solutions for 10M Embedding Scale"
  research_id: "MEM_004"
  question: "Which vector database solution best meets our requirements for 10M embeddings with <50ms p95 query latency while staying under $1000/month?"

  category: "MEM"
  priority: "high"
  complexity: "medium"
  confidence_level: "high"

  estimated_effort: "3 weeks"
  estimated_completion: "2024-02-05"

  methodology: "Comparative benchmarking with production-like workloads"

  success_criteria:
    - "Identify solution meeting <50ms p95 latency at 10M embeddings"
    - "Total monthly cost under $1000 including infrastructure"
    - "Migration path requiring <2 weeks implementation"
    - "Solution maintainable by current team without extensive training"
```

### Example 2: Development Workflow Research

```yaml
research_proposal:
  title: "Optimize CI/CD Pipeline for Monorepo Structure"
  research_id: "DEV_002"
  question: "How can we reduce CI/CD time from 45min to under 15min while maintaining test coverage?"

  category: "DEV"
  priority: "medium"
  complexity: "high"
  confidence_level: "medium"

  estimated_effort: "4 weeks"
  estimated_completion: "2024-02-20"

  methodology: "Profiling, experimentation, and incremental optimization"

  success_criteria:
    - "Achieve <15min CI/CD time for 90% of builds"
    - "Maintain 90%+ test coverage"
    - "Zero increase in flaky test rate"
    - "Developer productivity improvement measurable"
```

## Validation Rules

1. **Required Fields**: All fields except `hypothesis` and `related_work` are
   required
2. **ID Format**: Must match pattern `[A-Z]{3}_\d{3}`
3. **Date Format**: ISO 8601 (YYYY-MM-DD)
4. **List Fields**: At least one item required
5. **Success Criteria**: Minimum 2, maximum 6 criteria
6. **Estimate Alignment**: Effort must align with complexity rating

## Usage Notes

- This template is filled by the Research Intake Agent
- Validated using Pydantic model `ResearchProposal`
- Stored in `proposals/` directory
- Triggers `research.proposed` event when complete
- Becomes input for Research Planning Agent
