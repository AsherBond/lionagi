# Event 002: Research Proposed

## Event Definition

```yaml
event:
  id: "002"
  name: "research.proposed"
  description: "Research proposal created and awaiting planning"
  triggers:
    - "Label changed to 'stage:research.proposed'"
    - "Proposal file created in proposals/"
    - "Previous event 001 completed successfully"
  stage: "planning"
  parallelizable: true
```

## Trigger Conditions

- Has label: `stage:research.proposed`
- Has valid `research_id` in issue
- Proposal YAML exists at `proposals/{research_id}.yaml`
- No research plan exists yet

## Required Context

```yaml
context_required:
  - research_id: "From event 001"
  - proposal_file: "proposals/{research_id}.yaml"
  - issue_number: "GitHub issue reference"
  - category: "Research category"
  - priority: "Assigned priority"
```

## Agent Assignment

- **Primary**: Research Planning Agent
- **Support**: Context Discovery Agent (parallel)
- **Optional**: Domain Expert Agents (based on category)

## Expected Outputs

1. Detailed research plan (plans/{research_id}_plan.yaml)
2. Resource requirements identified
3. Timeline with milestones
4. Risk assessment
5. Data collection strategy

## State Transitions

- **Success**: â†’ Event 003 (research.active)
- **Needs Approval**: â†’ Hold in current state for human review
- **Blocked**: â†’ If resources unavailable

## Validation Rules

- Proposal must be approved (if high priority)
- Resources must be available
- Timeline must be realistic
- No conflicting research in progress

## GitHub Label Updates

```yaml
on_start:
  add: ["status:planning", "agent:planner"]
  remove: ["status:ready"]

on_success:
  add: ["stage:research.active", "has:plan"]
  remove: ["stage:research.proposed", "status:planning"]

on_blocked:
  add: ["status:blocked", "needs:resources"]
  remove: ["status:planning"]
```

## Comment Templates

### Planning Start

- `REJECT` with rationale
```

## Parallel Execution

When multiple research proposals exist, planning can occur in parallel:

- Max parallel planning: 5 agents
- Resource conflict detection across plans
- Automatic serialization if conflicts detected

## Monitoring Metrics

- Planning time: <20 minutes average
- Plan approval rate: >90%
- Resource conflict rate: <10%
- Milestone accuracy: Â±15%
