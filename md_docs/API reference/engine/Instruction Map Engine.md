### Class: `InstructionMapEngine`

**Description**:
`InstructionMapEngine` manages the execution of a mapped set of instructions across multiple branches within an executable structure. It orchestrates the flow of instructions and handles communication between branches through a mailbox and mail transfer system.

**Attributes**:
- `branches` (Pile\[[[Branch Engine#^209f34|BranchExecutor]]\]): A collection of branch executors managing individual instruction flows.
- `structure_id` (`str`): The identifier for the structure within which these branches operate.
- `mail_transfer` ([[Exchange#^2a685d|Exchange]]): Handles the transfer of mail between branches and other components.
- `branch_kwargs` (`dict`): Keyword arguments used for initializing branches.
- `num_end_branches` (`int`): Tracks the number of branches that have completed execution.
- `mail_manager` ([[Mail Manager#^51e936|MailManager]]): Manages the distribution and collection of mails across branches.

**Methods**:

#### `__init__`
Initializes an `InstructionMapEngine` with the given parameters.

**Signature**:
```python
def __init__(self, **kwargs)
```

**Parameters**:
- `**kwargs`: Arbitrary keyword arguments passed to the base executor and used for initializing branch executors.

#### `transfer_ins`
Processes incoming mails, directing them appropriately based on their categories, and handles the initial setup of branches or the routing of node and condition mails.

**Signature**:
```python
def transfer_ins(self)
```

**Returns**:
- `None`

#### `transfer_outs`
Processes outgoing mails from the central mail transfer, handling end-of-execution notifications and routing other mails to appropriate recipients.

**Signature**:
```python
def transfer_outs(self)
```

**Returns**:
- `None`

#### `forward`
Forwards the execution by processing all incoming and outgoing mails and advancing the state of all active branches.

**Signature**:
```python
async def forward(self)
```

**Returns**:
- `None`

#### `execute`
Continuously executes the forward process at specified intervals until instructed to stop.

**Signature**:
```python
async def execute(self, refresh_time=1)
```

**Parameters**:
- `refresh_time` (`int`): The time in seconds between execution cycles.

**Returns**:
- `None`
