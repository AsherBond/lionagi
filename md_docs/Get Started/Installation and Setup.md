# Installation and Setup

Welcome to the LionAGI ecosystem, a suite designed for asynchronous intelligence and data handling.

## Getting Started with LionAGI

LionAGI offers a straightforward installation process, providing you with a robust foundation for intelligent agent automation and big data analysis.

To install LionAGI, simply run:

```bash
pip install lionagi
```

This will install the core LionAGI package, which is compatible with Python versions 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12.

## Setting Up Your Environment

Before you begin, you'll need to set up a few things:

1. **Environment Variables:**
   Make sure you have your `OPENAI_API_KEY` ready to go. You'll need this for LionAGI to communicate with OpenAI's models.

2. **.env File Configuration:**
   - Download the `.env_template` from our repository.
   - Fill in your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
   - Save the changes and rename the file to `.env`.
   - Place the `.env` file in your project's root directory to keep your keys secure and accessible.
