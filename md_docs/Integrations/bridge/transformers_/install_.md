### Functions: `get_pytorch_install_command`, `install_pytorch`, `install_transformers`

**Description**:
These functions manage the installation of PyTorch and the Transformers library. They determine the appropriate installation command based on the system architecture, execute the installation, and handle dependencies between libraries.

### Function: `get_pytorch_install_command`

**Signature**:
```python
def get_pytorch_install_command()
```

**Parameters**:
- None

**Returns**:
- `str`: The appropriate pip install command for PyTorch based on the system's CPU architecture.

**Description**:
Determines the appropriate pip install command for PyTorch based on the CPU architecture of the system. For Apple Silicon, it uses the nightly build, while for other architectures, it uses the default CPU installation.

**Usage Example**:
```python
command = get_pytorch_install_command()
print(command)  # Output: pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

### Function: `install_pytorch`

**Signature**:
```python
def install_pytorch()
```

**Parameters**:
- None

**Returns**:
- None

**Description**:
Executes the installation of PyTorch using the command obtained from `get_pytorch_install_command`. It runs the installation command and prints a success message if the installation completes without errors. If an error occurs during the installation, it prints an error message.

**Usage Example**:
```python
install_pytorch()  # Installs PyTorch and prints the success or failure message
```

### Function: `install_transformers`

**Signature**:
```python
def install_transformers()
```

**Parameters**:
- None

**Returns**:
- None

**Description**:
Checks if PyTorch and the Transformers library are installed. If PyTorch is not installed, it prompts the user to install it and proceeds with the installation if the user agrees. Similarly, it checks for the Transformers library and installs it if the user agrees.

**Usage Example**:
```python
install_transformers()  # Installs Transformers and its dependencies, prompting the user if necessary
```

### Detailed Examples

#### Example for `get_pytorch_install_command`

```python
command = get_pytorch_install_command()
print(command)
# Output: pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
# or
# pip install --pre torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/nightly/cpu
```

#### Example for `install_pytorch`

```python
install_pytorch()
# Output: PyTorch installed successfully.
# or
# Failed to install PyTorch: <error message>
```

#### Example for `install_transformers`

```python
install_transformers()
# Output:
# PyTorch is required for transformers. Would you like to install it now? (y/n): y
# PyTorch installed successfully.
# transformers is required. Would you like to install it now? (y/n): y
# Transformers installed successfully.
```
