# LionAGI v0.3.0 (Development) - Language InterOperable Network
### An Emerging Agentic Intelligence Operating System

**IMPORTANT: This version is in active development and is NOT ready for use or installation.**

## Current Development Status

LionAGI v0.3.0 is our most ambitious update yet, aiming to create a comprehensive agentic OS. However, it's crucial to understand:

- This version is not available on PyPI
- It's not suitable for any production or practical use
- Features are under heavy development and may change significantly

## What We're Working On

1. **Completing lion-core**: Building the foundational framework
2. **Redesigning Workflow Automation**: Integrating advanced ML models
3. **Reimagining Agent Architecture**: Creating more flexible intelligent agents
4. **Expanding Tool Integration**: Developing a broader range of tools
5. **Cloud Integration**: Implementing AWS EC2 and S3 modules
6. **Visualization**: Developing a ReactFlow interface for AI workflows
7. **Testing Infrastructure**: Ensuring reliability as we develop
